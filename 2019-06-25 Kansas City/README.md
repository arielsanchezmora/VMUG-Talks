## Original abstract submission:

**Session Title**  

vCommunity sourced & proven best practices for vSphere with vSAN and NSX

**Perceived Need**  

- Understand VMware's Hardware Compatibility List, interoperability Matrix and the Update Sequence for compatible products
- Learn how handling storage operations can impact the patching and update process, and the timelines involved
- Simplify compute, storage and networking concepts as layers that depend on each other
- Plan better, remediate faster


**Session Description**  

vSphere is VMware's most deployed product and what most virtualization admins are familiar with, but vSAN and NSX have steadily been gaining adoption and the collective vCommunity skills are growing. As more admins are drawn to these and other next generation solutions they find that the "traditional" patching and upgrade processes now have more dependencies and requirements.

We'll do a deep dive into patching environments that have both vSAN and NSX, but all additional products introduce changes, so we will review several common use cases. We will cover other topics such as documentation, change scheduling, and handling expectations. Come to this talk and learn from the lessons learned in the #vCommunity as we review the theory and the practice.

This is a community talk; you will hear the good, the bad and the ugly, and about the #vCommunity!
