# SaltStack - from zero to useful

A vCommunity session

First recorded for the [Northwest Regional VMUG Virtual Usercon](https://www.vmug.com/events2/vmug-usercon/2021-northwest-regional-virtual-usercon), also known as the Seattle Usercon when we were able to travel to places :)


## Session description

SaltStack was already known as a configuration management for the fastest deployment times and a competitor to Puppet and Ansible. When VMware acquired the solution in 2020, it was added to vRealize Automation to complete the deployment and management puzzle.

Come to this session to learn how to get started with SaltStack and and how to setup a lab environment. Expect to get tips, tricks and source code to start managing virtual infrastructure and VM OS configurations. We will also discuss differences with other solutions such as Ansible. We will use the open source version and highlight differences with the new products where appropriate.
